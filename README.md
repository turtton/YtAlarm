YtAlarm is a simple alarm application using youtubedl-android. It makes be possible to wake up with a video/music which you like.  
This application does not use Google's developer services or service-dpendent APIs such as YoutubeAPI, so it will work without problems on any Android device that meets the supported Api level(probably).  
Also, you do not need an account for each service to use this app.
